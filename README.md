# serverless-plugin-rust
> ⚡️ A Serverless Framework plugin for building, testing, and deploying robust and efficient Rust services to AWS Lambda.

This project was clearly inspired by the following existing Serverless Framework plugins:
* [serverless-rust-plugin](serverless_rust_plugin) 
* [sls-rust](sls_rust)
* [serverless-rust](serverless_rust)

and builds upon some of the ideas presented in those plugins. However, most of the Rust plugins for the Serverless Framework seem outdated, and considering that the AWS Lambda community for Rust has started with the [cargo lambda](https://www.cargo-lambda.info/) project, and the awslabs teams is actively developing the new [aws lambda rust runtime](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime), i stronly believe a more active rust plugin for the Serverless Framework seem like something that is going to be needed for the future of serverless Rust on AWS Lambda.

Therefore, you should see this plugin as a merged fork of all the three above existing plugins; but rewritten as its own plugin.
